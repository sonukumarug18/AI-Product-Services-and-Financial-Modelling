# AI Product Services and Financial Modelling

This Project AI Product Services and Financial Modelling was part of an internship in Feynn LabsÂ©, under Mr. Sanjay Basumatary (Internship Guide). Me(Sonu Kumar-Team Lead) along with my teammates Akash Pratap Singh, Habiba Anjum, Tanmay Pawar , Chandru J, Ayush Kumar as a team to Automate existing AML software by implementing ML and AI algorithms, and find the best model which accurately predicts/prevents suspicious financial transactions.

More information about this Project.

1. Problem Statement-
    To recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase algorithms.

2. Sources:
   (a) Data:   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
   (b) Date:    28th May 2022. (Project Date)

3. Techniques and Algorithms used -
    Machine learning using python.In this project Implemented ML Techniques Like Logistic Regression, Linear-SVM, XGboost To recognize           fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase and also reduced log-             loss(random model) from 0.85 to 0.16. 

4. Conclusions-
   1. XGboost has log loss 0.16 less than Linear SVM 0.69 and Logistic Regression 0.68.
   2. Overall XGboost is the best ML model to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.
   3. We can also reduce this loss by increasing the sample size(oversampling) or use deep learning algorithms however at the cost of             computational expense.
